# Yawn-Detector-and-Counter

This is more like an app which basically keeps a live track of my face using a webcam and it analyzes when I yawn and as soon as I do it increments counter here. It is done by keeping a live track of my facial landmarks. When the facial landmark function detects some large separation between my upper and lower lips, the counter is getting incremented.

   * OpenCV in Python
   * Dlib
